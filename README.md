# Attendance-System-using-Facial-Recognition
Attendance System using Facial Recognition
This project is an attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of taking attendance. The system is implemented in Python, making use of the face-recognition library to perform facial recognition tasks.
Features
  Automatic attendance taking based on facial recognition
  Support for adding and managing multiple students/employees
  Real-time face detection and recognition

Requirements
    Python 3.x
    face-recognition library: Install using pip install face-recognition
    Webcam or video input device for real-time face detection

The system will capture frames from the webcam or video input and perform facial recognition. Detected faces will be compared against the trained model to recognize individuals and mark their attendance.

View and manage attendance records:

The attendance records will be stored in a CSV file by default within the project folder.
You can open the CSV file using a spreadsheet application to view and manage the attendance records.
